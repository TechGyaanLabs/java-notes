# Top 3 Data Structure Interview Questions

## 1. What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing, managing, and storing data in a format that enables efficient access and modification. It defines the relationship between the data and the functions that can be applied to it. Common types of data structures include:
- **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A sequence of elements, where each element points to the next.
- **Stacks**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Trees**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.

## 2. What is the difference between an Array and a Linked List?
- **Array**:
  - Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - Fixed size: The size of an array is defined at the time of declaration and cannot be changed.
  - Direct access: Allows random access to elements using their index.
  - Insertion and deletion of elements are time-consuming, especially in the middle of the array, due to the need for shifting elements.
- **Linked List**:
  - Elements are stored at non-contiguous memory locations and connected via pointers.
  - Dynamic size: The size can grow or shrink as needed during program execution.
  - Sequential access: Elements can only be accessed sequentially starting from the head node.
  - Insertion and deletion of elements are easier and more efficient, as there is no need to shift elements.
